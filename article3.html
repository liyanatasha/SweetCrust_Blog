        <h2>Perfect Pairings for Your Box</h2>
        <p>Every great bread deserves an equally great companion. Here are some pairing ideas to take your custom bread box to the next level:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For Sourdough:</strong>Pair with creamy butter, sharp cheddar, or tangy homemade chutney. Add a cup of teh tarik for that comforting Malaysian touch.</li>
            <li><strong>For Brioche:</strong>Think sweet—like kaya (a match made in bread heaven) or a drizzle of honey.</li>
            <li><strong>For Multigrain:</strong>Best enjoyed with hearty lentil soup or avocado spread. Feeling adventurous? Sprinkle chili flakes on top for a spicy kick.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Want to go the extra mile? Include spreads like fig jam, garlic butter, or even tropical pineapple chutney in your box. The possibilities are endless—and the fun is in the experimenting.</p>

        <h2>SweetCrust’s Seasonal Touch</h2>
        <p>One of the highlights of building your bread box is discovering our seasonal specialty loaf. Each season, our bakers create a limited-edition flavor inspired by local ingredients.</p>
        <p>From pandan-infused brioche to spiced pumpkin sourdough, these loaves are a celebration of Malaysia’s rich flavors and seasons. Including one in your box is like adding a little surprise gift for your taste buds every time you open it.</p>
